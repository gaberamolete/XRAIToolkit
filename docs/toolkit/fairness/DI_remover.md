# xrai_toolkit.fairness.fairness_algorithm.disparate_impact_remover
**[xrai_toolkit.fairness.fairness_algorithm.disparate_impact_remover(model, train_data, test_data, target_feature, protected, privileged_classes, favorable_classes=[1.0], repair_level=1.0)](https://github.com/gaberamolete/XRAIToolkit/blob/main/fairness/fairness_algorithm.py)**


Executes the AI Fairness 360's Disparate Impact Remover algorithm. Disparate impact remover is a preprocessing technique that edits feature values to increase group fairness while preserving rank-ordering within groups. The algorithm corrects for imbalanced selection rates between unprivileged andprivileged groups at various levels of repair.


**Parameters:**
-  model: the classifier model object
- train_data (pd.DataFrame): the train split from the dataset, must be preprocessed beforehand
- test_data (pd.DataFrame): the test split from the dataset, must be preprocessed beforehand
- target_feature (str): the target feature
- protected (list): list of protected features
- privileged_classes (list(list)): a 2d list containing the privileged classes for each protected feature
- favorable_classes (list): a list of favorable classes in the target feature, restricted to n-1 length, where n is the number of classes
- repair_level (int): how much the DI remover will change the input data to get DI close to 1

**Returns:**
- X_tr (np.array): Transformed X_train
- X_te (np.array): Transformed X_test
